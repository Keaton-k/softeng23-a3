* Questions
1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
##
* Answers
1. We think Task should be a string because task is a name of string for anycase, so we can make it simply.
1. We will add `pmgr make project` as a next feature which you can make new project. This answer dosen't change our previous answer because this feature doesn't affectã€€Task.
